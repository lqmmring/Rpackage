Description: we design an optimization framework based on non-dominated sorting genetics.
    This framework takes into account the topological relationship between cells 
    and the variety of gene expression to iteratively search the global optimal solution, 
    thereby learning the Pareto optimal cell-cell affinity matrix. Finally, we use the 
    learned sparse relationship model between cells to improve data quality and 
    reduce data noise.
